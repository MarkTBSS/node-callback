#Most Usecase Callback
```
Asynchronous Operations: Callbacks are extensively used to handle asynchronous operations such as reading files, database operations, or making HTTP requests. This allows the program to continue running without waiting for the operation to complete, thus improving efficiency and performance.

Example: Reading a file in Node.js
node asynchronous_operations.js
```

```
Higher-Order Functions: Callbacks are used in higher-order functions that take other functions as arguments or return them. This is common in array methods like map, filter, reduce, etc.

Example: Using map to create a new array
node higher_order_functions.js
```

```
Custom Callbacks: Developers often use callbacks to provide flexibility in their code, allowing users of their functions or libraries to specify custom behavior that should happen under certain conditions.

Example: A simple custom callback function
node custom_callbacks.js
```

```
Handling Asynchronous Results: In Node.js and browser-based JavaScript, callbacks are used to handle the results of asynchronous operations, such as the response from an AJAX request or the completion of a file read operation.

Example: Making an AJAX request
node handling_asynchronous_results.js
```
